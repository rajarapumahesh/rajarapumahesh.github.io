        <h2>About ”Low Cost Sanitary Pad Product Manufacturing Machine” in Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi
(”UNNATI” MAHOTSAV) and this Project/Machine designed under the UNNAT BHARAT ABHIYAN</h2>
	<p>We recently had the privilege of presenting our project at the 'MAHOTSAV & EXPO "UNNATI-Unnat Bharat Abhiyan Networking for National Atmanirbhar Technological Intervention"'. Our project is part of the Participating Institute Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (PIUBA), representing the esteemed Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, our institution.

Our project titled "Making of sanitary pads using low-cost and eco-friendly machinery" was selected under the category of Basic Amenities, in a national-level event held at IIT Delhi. This event served as a platform to showcase innovative projects and connect with numerous pioneers and individuals in the field. We were honored to be among the 75 projects selected for this prestigious program.

At IIT Delhi, we had the opportunity to present our project to an audience comprising innovators, experts, and enthusiasts from various backgrounds. We shared our research, findings, and the significant impact our low-cost and environmentally friendly machinery can have on improving access to sanitary pads.

Participating in this event not only allowed us to demonstrate our project's value but also provided a platform for collaboration and knowledge exchange. The diverse range of projects showcased at the event inspired us and fostered a spirit of innovation and progress.

We are proud to have been part of this national-level program and grateful for the recognition our project received. The experience gained and connections established during the event will undoubtedly fuel our commitment to developing solutions that address crucial societal needs.</p>
